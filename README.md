# WHY THIS PROJECT?  
BARKER BROWSER is a project to make my own internet browsing more easy.  I am type of person who likes to open a lot of tabs and websites at once. Sometimes I just procrastinate but more often I prefer to open a lot of links during my research (eg when I was looking how to implement inter process communications in Electron), I typicaly open 5-20 different tabs just for one topic. 
After reading each tabs I close it but sometimes I am interrupted with other activity and tabs remain opened.

So naturaly occured an idea for a split screen functionality. Although major browsers dare to offer max 2 browser windows at one time,  Barker Browser offers more layouts (1, 2, 4, 9, 16, 25 and optionaly also more). 
This opens new possibilities of usecases like watching more TV channels at the same time and reading news in other windows on one screen.
