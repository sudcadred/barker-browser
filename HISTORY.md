# HISTORY
development started from 1.1.2024 
(first concepts were done a month or two before that time but real work started in 2024)

## 2024 week1 
* basic UI (one address input for whole tab)
* create tab, delete tab, rename tab

## 2024 week2 
* zoom one browser window to another window (replaced by better navigation strategy in week3 :)

## 2024 week3 
* UI redesign (one address for each displayed browser window, possibility to roll windows)
* save tabs / load addresses at startup
* introduced browser window header (icons back/forward, refresh, clear page)
* open link in next window
* find text in page (ctrl+f)

## 2024 week4 
* file download
* settings
* keyboard shortcuts to access individual tabs / layouts
* left sidebar

## 2024 week5 
* bookmarks
* 'more actions' button in browser header (mute, unmute, find in, save, print, bookmark)
* suggestion box for previously typed addresses
* show link on hover
* 'show development console' added to more actions button

## 2024 week6
* open all bookmarks in new tab


# NEXT STEPS
